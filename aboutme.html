            <p>Hello. I am Samantha Hannah and though I am a 3D Artist from Scotland, I started out as a Biology graduate. </p>
            <br>
              <p>Although I gain both a BSc and MSc, I stuggled with unemployment in my field and found myself working a manual labour job that, though I was employed, it wasn't the dream career that hoped for. I knew that I always had a passion for 3D Art and decided to start a HND in 3D Computer Animation, which I did well enough in to start 3rd year of a BSc at Edinburgh Napier University. I graduated in 2020 with a First Class Honours in BSc Digital Media & Interaction Design from Edinburgh Napier University. Since then, I have since gained experience as Graphic Designer and a Technical Artist.</p>
            <br>

      <div class = "TextExpanded">
        <p>At College and university, I have worked on various projects involving 3D models/animations, VFX and motion graphics. Projects involved the use of 3D programs like Maya, 3DS Max, Mudbox, Zbrush and Substance Painter, and After Effects, Illustrator and Photoshop for VFX, Motion graphics, concept art and story boarding. I am also very interested in Augmented Reality having undertaken an Honours project involving creating an app showing knitting instructions in AR.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a Graphic Designer I worked on illustrations, motion graphics and animated presentations for a small oil & gas company. As a Technical Artist for 3finery, I helped with game design for mobile and created 3D character animations. I used Blender to create blendshapes and the basis for a facial rig that would be used in Unity for facial tracking, as well as create the character animations before importing them to unity. I also helped support the art team by creating motion graphics, any art-related tasks succh as character drawings, texturing and UI design. As part of my role, I was also involved in building small environments and UI interaction for mini Unity demonstrations. This also involved interactive scripting in C#. In my spare time I even produced some of my own mixed reality projects like an interactive AR cup and a VR Japanese shrine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My current personal projects include:- building a 3D Art portfolio with 3D game-ready props using Blender, Substance and Unreal; this website which is a Figma project that I am currently translating to code; and an interactive AR CV which I am currently building with Unity's ARFoundation.</p>
